=== tv_unable_to_pick_up_desktop_sound ===

--- Issue ---
TV is unable to pick up audio from desktop using HDMI.

--- Additional information ---
Realtek Digital Output (Realtek(R) Audio) is present but there's no "1 - LG TV SSCR2 (AMD High Definition Audio Device)"

--- Notes ---
The issue is associated with device drivers, specifically the graphics drivers. Sound is carried via HDMI to the TV. 1 end plugged into the TV and the other into the GPU.

A recent update bugged out the graphics driver, so a fresh/clean uninstall and reinstall resolved the situation.

--- Solution ---
Uninstall the application: "AMD Software" from device. Reinstall device drivers from website.
