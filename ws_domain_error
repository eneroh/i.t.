=== “The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed” ===

--- Cause ---
When speaking with the user initially, it was determined that the user had been away from the primary office for 4 years

Not only this but also there was no proper I.T. support assisting the user for an undisclosed amount of time.

Google suggests the following as causes:
- Broken Secure Channel
  > Passwords can become out of sync, between AD and the machine
- DNS issues
- Time synchronisation errors
  > Sensitivity between Kerberos the authentication protocol behind AD
- Computer account issues
  > Reusing or resetting computer accounts in AD can cause problems
  > Password resets outside of normal domain procedures
  > Compuer object is accidentally reused for a different machine
- Other factors
  > Replication issues between DCs
  > Virtual machine provision for the dc
  > Offline machines for longer than 90 days
