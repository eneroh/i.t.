=== fix_a_corrupted_user_profile_-_windows ===

--- Preface ---
Thinking in terms of User or Computer configurations.
For this to resolve the corrupted USER profile, you need to confirm this is only occurring on this specific machine with this specific user profile.

If this you have confirmed this and the user DOES not occur while logged into a colleagues machine WITH the corrupted profile. Then this issue will likely be resolved by this process.

--- Procedure ---
Ctrl + r > Type "AdvancedSystemProperties.exe" OR Press the windows key on your keyboard, type run, input in the run window "System Properties Advanced" > User Profiles > Settings > Select user profile that is corrupted > "Delete" and proceed

Get user to log in again shortly after, takes a while due to caching. The issue should be resolved. If it isn't it is likely a computer/machine issue.

--- Potential causes ---
The admin who worked on the machine previously may have an outdated version of SCCM/configuration manager and needs to update asap
