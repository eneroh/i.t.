=== windows_7_-_pull_files_from_machine_without_password ===
If unable to enter desktop/laptop running windows 7, it is possible to pull files from the operating system, while having an external drive plugged into the machine.

You can pull whatever files you would like but you need to utilize a cmd prompt or the windows settings present to view the folder directory.

Due to the lack of security in windows 7, drives are unencrypted by default and there's no real security measure in place as Windows 7 is no longer supported.

This was a particular situation for a colleague of mine, trying to get their old family photos off an old laptop.
