=== user requesting permissions ===

--- Procedure ---
1. Ensure a ticket/request is in place via the appropriate channels i.e. ticketing system
2. Check if procedure is already in place
  > If no procedure is in place, ask a colleague what procedure they perform is
  > If there is no procedure written or known, you will need to create your own procedure. Quite common in most Service Desks

3. Confirm if a colleague (someone in a similar role) has relevant permissions
4.1. Review the colleagues permissions and see how they differ from the requesting user
  > This may not always work therefore, you may also have to try the user's manager.
4.2. Confirm if manager has relevant permissions, if so compare here as well. Be very careful, DO NOT and I MEAN DO NOT provide all manager permissions to the user as this is BAD PRACTICE and can lead to a massive security risk.
  > While performing the above tests, test 1 or 2 groups at a time via AD. Once determined, record procedure for next analyst.
5. After testing performing testing with user via a private browsing windows to avoid caching, confirm if they consider the issue resolved and ask if there is anything else that they require help with.
6. Process complete

Congratulations, you have provided a user relevant permissions for their role/task at hand.
